# Case 11 PID line inspection

## Introduction

This course aims to enable students to learn and explore concepts such as judgment, branching, and-or-not in program design by making smart racing cars, and understand the working principle of line-following sensors and the basic principles of PID control. Through the practical operation, students will master the PID line inspection algorithm, cultivate logical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, and further improve the effect of the car's line inspection.

## Teaching process

### Course Introduction

Hello everyone! Today we're going to continue our smart car production project, but this time we're going to improve the car's line-following effect. Have you noticed that the car may vibrate or turn frequently during the previous line patrol? In order to make the car run along the black line more smoothly, we will introduce a new concept - PID control. PID control can help us to perform more precise control based on the feedback signal from the sensor.

PID is the abbreviation of Proportional, Integral and Derivative, which are three commonly used adjustment parameters in control systems. By adjusting these parameters properly, we can make the car follow the line better and reduce the deviation.

### Inquiry activities

How to use the line tracking sensor and PID control algorithm to make the car run smoothly along the black line? What are your thoughts and guesses?

Try to adjust the parameters in the PID control algorithm, and observe the effect on the car's line patrol effect.

Design and implement other line-following driving strategies, such as adjusting the driving speed according to the curvature of the line, etc.

Group discussions where students are encouraged to share their views and ideas
