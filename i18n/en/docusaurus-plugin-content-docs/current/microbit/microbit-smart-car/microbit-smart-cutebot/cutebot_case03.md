***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating incompatibility of the codebase, you can continue with the tips or build a new project there.

### Step 2

Choose "show icon" in the `On start`bricks.

### Step 3

Drag "go straight at full speed" and "set left wheel speed, right wheel speed" bricks into the `Forever` brick in turns.

Divide the "figure-of eight" track into six parts: move forward for 200ms at the beginning,  set the speed of the left wheel is faster than the right and set to move for 1000ms after, then go straight for 200ms.  Right now you have completed the half part of "figure-of-eight".

Complete the second half part of "figure-of-eight" in a similar way.
