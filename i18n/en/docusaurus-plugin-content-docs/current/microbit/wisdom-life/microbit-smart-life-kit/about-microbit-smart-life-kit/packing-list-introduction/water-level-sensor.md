# Water level sensor

Octopus Water level sensor is our OCTOPUS series of water level sensor electronic building blocks. Its basic design is set according to the OCTOPUS electronic building block series. Its appearance, PCB fixing holes, and electronic building block interface settings are the same.

The analog water level electronic building block is a simple, easy-to-use, cost-effective sensor that measures the water volume through a series of exposed parallel wires to determine the water level.

Easily complete the conversion of water volume to analog signal, and the output analog value can be directly read by micor:bit to achieve the function of water level alarm.

Special note: The components above the MAX water level line are not waterproof, so do not immerse them in water.
