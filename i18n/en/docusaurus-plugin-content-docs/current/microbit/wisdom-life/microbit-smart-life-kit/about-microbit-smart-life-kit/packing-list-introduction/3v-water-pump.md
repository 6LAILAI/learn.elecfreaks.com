# 3V Water Pump

The 3V water pump is a small, compact water pump that is commonly used in water treatment systems in homes, industry and agriculture.

In a 3V water pump, there are two main parts: the impeller and the pump casing. The impeller is a rotating component that creates centrifugal force by rotating, drawing water in through the inlet of the pump casing and pushing it out along the outlet of the pump casing.

As the impeller rotates, the water is drawn into the center of the impeller and then thrown toward the edge of the impeller. During this process, the pressure and velocity of the water increases. As the water leaves the edge of the impeller, it is guided by the pump casing to an outlet from which it flows out of the pump body.

In the pump casing, one or more passages connect the impeller outlet to the inlet. These passages are often referred to as deflectors or guide vanes. The function of the deflector is to direct the flow of water and to minimize spinning and turbulence.

In addition to the impeller and pump casing, a 3V water pump includes a motor section. The motor drives the impeller to rotate, which in turn drives the flow of water. The type of motor can be an AC motor, a DC motor or a stepper motor, among others.

The 3V vertical water pump is a DC miniature submersible pump that leads to a male and female Dupont wire connector, which is easy to wire and can be used in a variety of process fountains.
