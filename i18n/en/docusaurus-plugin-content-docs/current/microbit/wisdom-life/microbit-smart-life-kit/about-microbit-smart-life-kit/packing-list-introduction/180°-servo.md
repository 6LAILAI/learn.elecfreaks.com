# 180째 Servo

A servo motor is often called a servo. It is a small device with an output shaft. When we send a control signal to the servo, the output shaft can be rotated to a specific position. As long as the control signal remains unchanged, the servo mechanism will keep the angular position of the shaft unchanged. If the control signal changes, the position of the output shaft will also change accordingly. In daily life, servos are often used in remote control aircraft, remote control cars, robots and other fields.
