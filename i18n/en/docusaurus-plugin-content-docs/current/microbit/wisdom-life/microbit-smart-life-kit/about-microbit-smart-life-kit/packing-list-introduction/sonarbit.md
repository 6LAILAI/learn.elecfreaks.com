# Sonar:bit

Sonar:bit is a sensor module based on ultrasonic sensing technology, designed for micro:bit educational development board.

It can be used to measure distance and detect obstacles, providing users with a simple and reliable way to achieve distance measurement and obstacle avoidance. Sonar:bit uses ultrasonic sensors, which can emit ultrasonic signals to the surroundings and calculate the distance between the object and the sensor by receiving echoes. It has high accuracy and stability and can measure a range of 2 cm to 400 cm.

By programming micro:bit, users can implement various applications based on the measurement results of Sonar:bit, such as the obstacle avoidance function of smart cars, distance measurement, etc. In short, users can create a variety of interesting applications. Whether it is education or maker projects, Sonar:bit is an indispensable tool.
