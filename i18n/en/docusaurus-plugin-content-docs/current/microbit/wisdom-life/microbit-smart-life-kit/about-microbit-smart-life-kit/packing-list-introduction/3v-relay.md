# Water Level Sensor

3V relay is an electrical switch that can open or close a circuit by controlling the current. It consists of an electromagnetic coil and a set of switch contacts. When current passes through the electromagnetic coil, it generates a magnetic field, which attracts or pushes the contacts, thereby opening or closing the circuit.

1 Channel Relay 3V Relay Module is a relay electronic building block in our OCTOPUS series. Its basic design is set according to the OCTOPUS electronic building block series. Its appearance, PCB fixing holes, and electronic building block interface settings are the same. OCTOPUS 1 Channel Relay uses ultra-small, high-quality HUIKE relays, which can control various household appliances and high-current loads. It is a common accessory module for DIY of electronic enthusiasts.
