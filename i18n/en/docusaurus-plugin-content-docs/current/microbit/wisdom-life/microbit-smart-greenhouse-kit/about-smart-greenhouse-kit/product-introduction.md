# Smart Greenhouse kit

## Introduction

Smart Greenhouse kit is an excellent plant growth simulation kit designed for primary and secondary school students, aiming to help the younger generation gain a deeper understanding of the principles and practical applications of modern smart planting. In this carefully designed kit, we have combined the most cutting-edge technology with practical educational concepts, allowing students to experience the entire process of smart plant growth management.

This kit consists of a transparent greenhouse cover, a greenhouse chassis, an IOT:bit expansion board and a number of sensors.

This kit uses micro:bit as the main board, making full use of the intuitiveness of graphical programming, so that students can easily get started. Through simple programming commands, students can monitor and control the various functions of the greenhouse in real time, and transmit plant growth data to the dashboard of the IoT platform for further data analysis and sharing.

For tomorrow's green future, let our students start today and experience the charm of smart planting with Smart Greenhouse kit!
