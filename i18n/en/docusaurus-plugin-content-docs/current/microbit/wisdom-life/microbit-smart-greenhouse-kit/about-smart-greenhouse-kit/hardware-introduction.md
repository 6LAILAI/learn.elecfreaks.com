The IOT:bit Expansion Board is a feature-rich expansion board designed for micro:bit. Here is a more detailed description:

**WiFi Module:**
The IOT:bit has a WiFi module on board, enabling you to easily connect to a wireless network. With the WiFi module, you can enable fast communication with cloud platforms such as Thingspeak and HiveMQ to transfer data to and from the cloud. This opens up vast possibilities for connectivity and remote control of your smart projects.

**RTC Clock Module:**
The IOT:bit integrates an RTC clock module (Real Time Clock), which has a precise timing function. The independently powered RTC module continues to keep time even if the motherboard is powered down. This provides continuous accurate time recording for your applications such as time stamps, timed tasks and event triggering.

**Buzzer:**
The IOT:bit includes a buzzer through which you can play melodies, sound effects or alarm sounds. The buzzer is capable of producing sounds at different frequencies, adding audible feedback and interactivity to your projects.

**IO Port Expansion:**
The IOT:bit extends all the IO ports available on the micro:bit with GVS pins for easy connection to a variety of 3V building block modules. You can expand various modules, such as LED lights, photosensors, servos, etc., to build richer and more diversified intelligent systems.

The IOT:bit Expansion Board is feature-rich and can meet your needs in smart system development. It provides WiFi connection, RTC clock, buzzer and IO port expansion, etc., which brings more possibilities to your project. Not only can it realize fast data transmission and remote control, but also add sound effects and access to various sensors to make your smart system more intelligent and interactive.

A 3V relay is an electrical switch that opens or closes a circuit by controlling the current. It consists of an electromagnetic coil and a set of switch contacts. When current passes through the solenoid coil, it generates a magnetic field which attracts or pushes the contacts apart, thus opening or closing the circuit.

1 Channel Relay 3V Relay Module is our OCTOPUS series one way relay electronic block, its basic design is set according to the OCTOPUS electronic block series, its shape, PCB fixing holes, and the interface of the electronic block are set in the same way. 1 Channel Relay is made of ultra-small, high quality OCTOPUS 1 Channel Relay adopts ultra-small and high quality HUIKE relay, which can control various household appliances and high current loads. OCTOPUS 1 Channel Relay is a popular DIY accessory module for electronics enthusiasts.

## Octopus 3V Vertical Water Pump

The 3V water pump is a small, compact water pump that is commonly used in water treatment systems in homes, industry and agriculture.

In a 3V water pump, there are two main parts: the impeller and the pump casing. The impeller is a rotating component that creates centrifugal force by rotating, drawing water in through the inlet of the pump casing and pushing it out along the outlet of the pump casing.

As the impeller rotates, the water is drawn into the center of the impeller and then thrown toward the edge of the impeller. During this process, the pressure and velocity of the water increases. As the water leaves the edge of the impeller, it is guided by the pump casing to an outlet from which it flows out of the pump body.

In the pump casing, one or more passages connect the impeller outlet to the inlet. These passages are often referred to as deflectors or guide vanes. The function of the deflector is to direct the flow of water and to minimize spinning and turbulence.

In addition to the impeller and pump casing, a 3V water pump includes a motor section. The motor drives the impeller to rotate, which in turn drives the flow of water. The type of motor can be an AC motor, a DC motor or a stepper motor, among others.

The 3V vertical water pump is a DC miniature submersible pump that leads to a male and female Dupont wire connector, which is easy to wire and can be used in a variety of process fountains.



## Octopus 8 Rainbow LED Light

8 RGB Rainbow Beads Light Ring is a very interesting and useful learning tool. This light ring adopts the principle of RGB three basic colors, by controlling the brightness of red, green and blue LEDs, you can adjust the color and brightness emitted by the light ring to achieve colorful visual effects. By observing the color changes of the light ring, it can help students understand the principle of RGB three primary colors and the principle of mixing colors. At the same time, the brightness of the light beads can also be adjusted manually to cultivate students' hands-on ability and observation skills. In addition, you can also use this light ring for creative design and DIY production to cultivate students' creativity and imagination.

## Octopus Soil Moisture Sensor

A soil moisture sensor is a device used to measure soil moisture. It usually consists of a sensor probe and a data collector. Soil moisture sensors work by measuring the moisture content in the soil to infer the moisture content of the soil. The sensor probe of the Octopus series of soil moisture sensors consists of an electrically conductive metal sheet whose resistance changes when the moisture content in the soil changes. The data collector reads the resistance value of the conductive metal sheet and converts it to a soil moisture value. Soil moisture sensors are a very useful tool to help us better understand the moisture condition of the soil to guide applications such as agricultural production and plant growth.

## Octopus Light Sensor
