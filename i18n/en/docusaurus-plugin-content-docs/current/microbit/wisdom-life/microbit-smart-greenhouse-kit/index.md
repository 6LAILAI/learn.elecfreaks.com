# Smart Greenhouse Kit(EF08313)

Smart Greenhouse Kit is an excellent plant growth simulation kit designed for primary and secondary school students, aiming to help the younger generation gain a deeper understanding of the principles and practical applications of modern smart planting.

Smart Greenhouse Kit uses micro:bit as the main board and IoT:bit as the expansion board. Plant seeds are placed in the plant growth groove at the base of the greenhouse. The transparent greenhouse cover is used to observe the plant growth. Light sensors and soil moisture sensors are used to detect the plant growth environment. 8 rainbow light rings are used to change the plant lighting according to the changes in the environment, and 3V water pumps and relays are used to water the plants.

Students use a graphical programming platform. Through simple programming commands, students can intelligently control the plant growth environment and transmit the plant growth environment data to the IoT platform dashboard in real time, conduct in-depth data analysis and share their results.
