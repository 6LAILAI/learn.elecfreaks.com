## Limited Warranty

ELECFREAKS only warrants the physical product against normal use and hardware failure for a period of 60 days from the date the original purchaser receives the shipment of the retail purchase. Under this Limited Warranty, if a hardware defect is discovered and ELECFREAKS receives a valid after-sale request within the warranty period, ELECFREAKS will, to the extent permitted by law, repair the product free of charge with new or refurbished parts, or replace the product with a new or refurbished product, or, with the user's consent, mail replacement parts for the user to repair at the user's own expense. In the event of a hardware failure, these are your sole and exclusive remedies to the extent permitted by law. Replacement products or parts assume the remaining warranty time of the original product. When replacing a product or part of a product, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes the property of ELECFREAKS. Parts supplied by ELECFREAKS to fulfill its warranty obligations must be used on the product for which warranty service is claimed.

**Note: Customers purchasing products from a dealer should first contact the dealer directly for service. If you encounter a technical problem that the dealer cannot solve,  can contact ELECFREAKS at support@elecfreaks.com.
