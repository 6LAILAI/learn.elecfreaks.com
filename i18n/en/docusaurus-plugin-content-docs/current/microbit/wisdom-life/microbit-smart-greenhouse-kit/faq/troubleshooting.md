# Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems during use, please try the following methods to troubleshoot:

1. Check that all connections are firm and that the wires are not loose or damaged.

2. Check that the Dupont wires are installed in the correct direction or that the pin positions are correct.

3. Reinstall IOT:bit and re-download the program software to ensure that the program runs correctly.

4. Use the non-working components separately to see if the components are damaged.

5. Check the relevant documents and tutorials to confirm that your operation and code writing are correct.

6. If the problem persists, please contact the ENFU Technology team at support@elecfreaks.com for technical support.
