# Introduction to the course content

XGO-lite V2 is an interesting robot dog, whose design is inspired by the limbs and gait of a dog. It can perform functions such as autonomous walking, running and dynamic balance, and can be programmed to better help you and the bionic Makers interested in robotics learn about programming and robotics.

This tutorial outline contains a total of 11 topics, each topic involves different knowledge points and skills, so as to help you understand and master the basic operating principles and programming methods of the bionic quadruped robot dog.

First, you can learn how to use the XGO App to control the XGO-lite V2, so as to better experience the operation of this robot dog. Next, you will learn about the preparation of controlling XGO-lite V2 and the programming environment through graphical programming, as well as the introduction of the serial port and the first experience of programming. Afterwards, you will learn the method of action combination programming, and how to use XGO-lite V2 gesture memory programming to control the movement of the robot dog.

Next, we will introduce the concept of gait programming and explore how gait programming can be used to control the movement of a robot dog. In addition, you will learn how to program the robotic arm and speakers, which can change the XGO-lite V2 to be more interesting.

Finally, some methods of extended programming will be introduced, including using Joysticks handles, voice recognition sensors to control the movement of XGO-lite V2, and how to use the AI camera to recognize street signs or cards to control the movement of XGO-lite V2.

In short, this tutorial covers a lot of knowledge points and skills related to XGO-lite V2 programming, aiming to help you understand and master the basic operating principles and programming methods of the bionic quadruped robot dog.
