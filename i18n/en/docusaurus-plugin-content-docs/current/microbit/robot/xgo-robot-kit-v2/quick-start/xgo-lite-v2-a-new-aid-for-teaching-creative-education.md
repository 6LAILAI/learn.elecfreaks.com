# XGO-lite V2: A New Boost to Maker Education and Teaching

With the development of science and technology, artificial intelligence, robotics and other fields continue to make breakthroughs. In this context, the bionic four-legged robot dog, as an intelligent robot integrating technology and innovation, is gradually entering our lives. This article will explore the relationship between the bionic four-legged robot dog and maker education and teaching, and how to integrate it into maker education to inject new vitality into education and teaching.

## 1. What is a Bionic Quadruped Robot Dog?

The bionic quadruped robot dog is an intelligent robot with high flexibility and stability that imitates the movement of quadruped animals. Its quadruped motion structure can maintain stable movement in complex terrain environments and adapt to the needs of different scenarios. At the same time, the four-legged robot dog also has functions such as environment perception and autonomous navigation, and can complete various complex tasks.

## 2. The Core Idea of Maker Education

Maker education is an educational concept that focuses on innovation and creation, advocates hands-on practice, and is project-driven. Its purpose is to cultivate students' hands-on ability, innovation ability, cooperation ability and problem-solving ability. Maker education emphasizes practical operations and encourages students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects to achieve innovation.
