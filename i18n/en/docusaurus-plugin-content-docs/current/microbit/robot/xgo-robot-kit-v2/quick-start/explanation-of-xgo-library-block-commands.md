# Explanation of XGO library building block commands

This document is written for creators who are new to XGO graphical programming, and the purpose is to let users have a detailed understanding of each building block command of the XGO library.

| Distributed               | block command                                           | illustrate                                                   |

| **Basic commands**        | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-1.png)  | The communication between XGO-lite and micro:bit is through the serial port. So first you need to set the TX (send) and RX (receive) port numbers of the communication serial port. <br />XGO-lite V2 defaults to TX-14, RX-13; <br />XGO-lite V1 defaults to TX-2, RX-1;<br />So when programming different XGO-lite versions , to select the corresponding TX, RX serial port numbers. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-2.png)  | XGO-lite has 19 standard actions by default, and these actions will not be interrupted during execution. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-32.png) | What is obtained is the version number of the firmware driver of the XGO-lite lower computer, and the returned data type is a string. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-31.png) | Get the battery level of the current state of XGO-lite.      |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-30.png) | Restore to the state after the XGO-lite is powered on and stabilized. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-29.png) | "Dynamic balance mode" means that when the plane on which XGO-lite stands shakes, XGO-lite will dynamically adjust the angle of the quadruped servo to keep the fuselage parallel to the ground within a certain range. However, when performing other actions, the dynamic balance mode is turned off by default. |
| **Set the steering gear** | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-27.png) | Record all the servo angle values of the current XGO-lite into the variable "pose#". |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-26.png) | Set all servo angles of XGO-lite to the servo angle values saved in the variable "pose#". |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-28.png) | Get the servo angle value of each joint of XGO-lite's four legs. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-23.png) | Changing the value of "Servo Speed" will affect the block commands that directly control the servo. <br />Changing the value of "stepping frequency" will affect the command of the building block that controls the action. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-24.png) | Servo "load" means to make the joint servo generate driving force, and "unload" the servo means to make the servo lose driving force. This building block command is applied to all joint servos of XGO-lite. |
|                           | ![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com//images/microbit-xgo-lite-v2-xgolibrary-25.png) | This building block command acts on the joint servos of each leg of XGO-lite. |
