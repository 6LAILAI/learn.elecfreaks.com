## After-sales policy

## Returns and Exchanges

30 day return or exchange policy. To qualify for a return for a full refund, your item must be in the same condition as when you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging, or you received a defective item and sent pictures or video to ELECFREAKS as proof. If there is no quality issue with the product, return shipping is at the user's expense.

## Limited Warranty

ELECFREAKS only warrants the physical product against normal use and hardware failure for a period of 60 days from the date the original purchaser receives the retail purchase shipment. Under this Limited Warranty, if a hardware defect is discovered and ELECFREAKS receives a valid after-sale request within the warranty period, ELECFREAKS will, to the extent permitted by law, repair the product free of charge with new or refurbished parts, or replace the product with a new or refurbished product, or, with the user's consent, mail replacement parts for the user to repair at their own expense. In the event of a hardware failure, these are your sole and exclusive remedies to the extent permitted by law. Replacement products or parts assume the remaining warranty time of the original product. When replacing a product or part of a product, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes the property of ELECFREAKS. Parts supplied by ELECFREAKS to fulfil its warranty obligations must be used for the product for which warranty service is claimed.
