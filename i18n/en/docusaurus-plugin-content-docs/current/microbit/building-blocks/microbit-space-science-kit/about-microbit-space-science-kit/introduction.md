# Introduction

The micro:bit Space Science Kit is a STEAM education kit designed for elementary and middle school students. The kit uses the Nezha breakout board V2, the PlanetX Smart Motor, a variety of PlanetX sensors, a scenario-based map of the moon landing plan, and a number of building blocks to allow students to build projcts and realise simulation missions on the moon.
