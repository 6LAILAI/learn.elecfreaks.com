# Help Technical Support Locate the Problem

Dear User, Thank you for choosing our product!

Since there are many possibilities we need to consider to understand what is happening with your product, the more information you provide, the better we can understand the situation and the faster we can provide recommendations and resolve the problem.

This article lists some of the key pieces of information that can help us solve the problem. When you send an email to Technical Support at support@elecfreaks.com, please include the following information. Thank you!

## 1. Product Failure Videos

Take a video of a product having a problem. If you miss it, see if you can reproduce the problem, then shoot the video and send it to us. This way we can see the same thing you saw and eliminate any ambiguity or loss of information in the communication process. A good video is more accurate than describing the problem in a thousand words.

## 2. Software Version
