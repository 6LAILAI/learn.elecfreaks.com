### Teamwork and Presentation

Students are divided into small groups and work together to create and program the returner.

Students are encouraged to cooperate, communicate and share their experiences with each other.

Each group will have the opportunity to show the other groups the returners they have made and demonstrate them.

**Expected results:** After starting up, the re-entry vehicle will travel along the lunar-terrestrial return trajectory, while displaying the temperature and humidity data of the "capsule".

### Summarize and Reflect

Review the course content and remind students what knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Lead students in a discussion about the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how they solved them.

Guide students to think about directions for optimization and improvement of returners, such as what other interesting cases can be made.

## Related Knowledge

The return vehicle during a lunar landing is a key component in accomplishing a lunar landing mission, responsible for safely bringing astronauts and scientific equipment from circumlunar orbit to the lunar surface and bringing astronauts back to circumlunar orbit after the mission is completed. The design of the Return Vehicle is very complex and requires multiple functions to meet the challenges of the lunar environment. Here is some general knowledge about the return vehicle composition:

### Basic composition

1. **Lunar Module**:
   - This is the part of the return vehicle that contains the astronauts, also known as the crew module or command module. It usually contains life support systems, communications equipment, navigation systems, and emergency escape devices.
2. **Propulsion Module**:
   - Contains the main engine and propellant tanks, which are used to control the descent rate and direction of the return vehicle to ensure a smooth landing and re-takeoff.
3. **Landing legs and cushions**:
   - Used to absorb shock during landing and prevent the returner from tipping over or being damaged.
4. **Solar panels**:
   - Provide electrical power, especially on long missions, for powering electronic equipment and keeping life support systems operational.
5. **Attitude Control System**:
   - Includes small thrusters and reaction wheels used to adjust the attitude of the return vehicle in space.
6. **Navigation and Guidance System**:
   - Uses laser rangefinders, inertial navigation units and astrometers to determine position and velocity and ensure accurate landings.
7. **Scientific instruments and laboratory equipment**:
   - May contain cameras, spectrometers, seismometers, etc., to perform scientific research and data collection.
8. **Lunar rovers or other ground vehicles**:
   - Some return vehicles may carry lunar rovers or rovers so that astronauts can leave the return vehicle for more extensive exploration.
9. **Sample collection and storage system**:
   - If the mission includes collection of lunar samples, the return vehicle will contain equipment for sample collection and storage.

### Special design considerations

- **Power system**: In order to land and take off on the Moon, the return vehicle must use a different propulsion system than chemical rockets because there is no atmosphere on the Moon to generate lift. A combination of liquid fuel and oxidizer is typically used.
- **Weight and size constraints**: The return vehicle must be as lightweight as possible to minimize launch costs and increase efficiency. At the same time, it needs to have enough space to accommodate astronauts and equipment.
- **Thermal control systems**: The temperature on the lunar surface is extremely variable, and the return vehicle must be able to maintain a suitable temperature inside.
- **Redundant Systems**: To ensure the safety of the astronauts, many of the critical systems are backed up in case a component fails.

### Specific examples

- **U.S. Apollo Eagle Return Vehicle**: consists of the Lunar Module and the Ascent Module, the latter being used for re-entry into circumlunar orbit.
- China's Lunar Range Return Vehicle (LRV): part of China's manned lunar landing program, designed to transport astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon.
- **NASA's Nova C return vehicle**: uses methane and oxygen as fuel and is designed to explore the south polar region of the Moon.

The design of each return vehicle varies according to its specific mission requirements and the spacecraft architecture used.
