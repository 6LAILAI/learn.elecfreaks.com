# Case 19 Counting Basketball Frame

## Introduction

In this project, we will use Nezha Inventor Kit V2 to make a model basketball hoop that will automatically count the number of goals scored. We will learn how the ultrasonic sound sensors work, the circuit connections, programming and apply them to the model basketball hoop.

## Teaching Objectives

- Learn how ultrasonic sensors work
- Learn to detect and count basketball goals using Nezha Inventor Kit V2
- Develop creativity and innovative thinking ability

## Teaching Preparation

[Nezha Inventor's Kit V2](https://www.elecfreaks.com/nezha-inventor-s-kit-v2-for-micro-bit.html)


## Teaching Process

### Introduce

>Introduce students to the background and objectives of the counting basketball hoop production to stimulate their interest and curiosity.

Basketball is a very popular sport and scoring a goal every time you shoot a basket is a sense of achievement. But how interesting and practical an invention would it be if we could make a model of a basketball hoop that automatically counts the number of goals scored?

### Exploration

>Discuss in groups and get students thinking about how to build a counting basketball hoop using the blocks.

- How do you connect an ultrasonic sound sensor to the circuit and implement the detection of basketball goals?
- How can the ultrasonic sound sensor detection be programmed to convert the results into a goal count?
- How do you design a reliable goal counting mechanism that ensures accurate counting of each goal scored?
- How to get creative and design an attractive model of a basketball hoop that can automatically display the number of goals scored?

### Practice

>Work in groups to build a counting basketball hoop from building blocks according to your own design.

Build a counting basketball hoop from blocks according to your own design.

### Reflection

>Share in groups so that students in each group can share their production process and insights, summarise the problems and solutions they encountered, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.
