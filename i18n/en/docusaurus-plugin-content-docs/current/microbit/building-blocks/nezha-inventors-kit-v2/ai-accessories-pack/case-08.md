### Teamwork and Presentation

Students are divided into small groups and work together to create and program cases.

Students are encouraged to cooperate, communicate and share their experiences with each other.

Each group has the opportunity to present the cases they have produced to the other groups.

#### Sample case effect

Select a specific item as the unlock code. Place it in front of the camera, press button A to learn the characteristics of the item, when you need to unlock it, place the specific item in front of the camera and press button B. If the item is correct, the combination lock opens, otherwise it cannot be opened.

### Reflection

>Sharing in groups allows students in each group to share their production process and insights, summarize the problems and solutions they encountered, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.


### Expanding Knowledge

* What is feature learning? *

Feature Learning (FL) is an important concept in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which refers to automatically learning and extracting useful features or representations from raw data in order to better represent the data so that data analysis, pattern recognition and decision making tasks can be better performed.

The main goal of feature learning is to transform high-dimensional, complex data into more concise and informative representations so that machine learning algorithms can understand and process the data more easily. This helps to improve the performance and generalization of the model, reduces the burden of data dimensionality, and also helps to discover hidden patterns and structures in the data.

Feature learning methods include traditional feature extraction methods (e.g. Principal Component Analysis PCA, Independent Component Analysis ICA) as well as deep learning methods (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network CNN, Autoencoder Autoencoder). Deep learning excels in feature learning because it is able to learn multi-level, abstract feature representations, gradually moving from low-level feature extraction to high-level abstract features, thus adapting to the needs of different tasks.

Feature learning has a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, recommender systems, and other fields, where it plays an important role in improving model performance and solving complex problems.
