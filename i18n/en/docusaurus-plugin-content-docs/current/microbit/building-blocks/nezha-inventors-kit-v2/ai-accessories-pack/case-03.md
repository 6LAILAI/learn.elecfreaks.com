# Case 03 Energy-saving Fan


## Introduction

In this creative STEAM project, students will combine the Nezha Inventor Kit V2 and the AI Accessories Pack to create a smart energy-saving fan. By using the face recognition function of the AI lens, the fan is able to recognise the proximity of a person and turn on automatically, and automatically adjusts the orientation of the fan through the mechanics of the worm gear so that the fan is always aligned with the position of the person's face. Through this project, students will learn how to combine AI technology with mechanical design to achieve smart energy savings.

## Teaching Process

### Introduce

>The teacher can guide students to think about the following questions: what modifications can we make to the face tracking device to make it more functional? Through these questions, students' interest will be aroused and they will be guided to think about how to combine technology with creativity.

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to create a smart fan that automatically starts when a person is near and can automatically adjust the orientation of the fan so that it is always positioned towards the person's face? In today's session, we will explore how to make a smart energy-saving fan that can not only bring us coolness, but also achieve energy saving through the face recognition function of AI lens and the mechanical principle of worm gear.

### Exploration

>Group discussion for students to think about how to make an AI energy-saving fan with an AI lens, focusing on the use of the face recognition function and possible scenarios for the use of face recognition devices in their lives.

- What is an AI energy saving fan and how does it work?
- What role does the worm gear play in the fan?
- How can the face recognition function of the AI lens be used to achieve automatic startup and orientation adjustment of the fan?
- What are the scenarios in which this smart energy-saving fan can be applied and what are the advantages?

### Practices

> Work in groups to make an AI energy-saving fan from building block materials according to your own design scheme.

Follow your own design scheme to make an AI energy-saving fan using building block materials.

### Teamwork and Display

Students are divided into small groups and work together to create and programme the case.

Students are encouraged to co-operate, communicate and share their experiences with each other.

Each group has the opportunity to present the cases they have produced to the other groups.

#### Example cases results

The face recognition device automatically identifies faces within range and when a face is recognised, it automatically switches on the fan and automatically adjusts the orientation of the fan according to the position of the face.

### Rflection

>Sharing in groups allows students in each group to share their production process and insights, summarise the problems and solutions they encountered, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.

### Extended knowledge

*** What is an AI energy saving fan and how does it work? ***

AI energy-saving fan is a kind of intelligent fan realised using artificial intelligence technology, which can sense the proximity of a person through sensors and automatically start and adjust the facing direction to achieve directional air supply to the human face. Its working principle is mainly to use the AI lens for face recognition, and through the face detection algorithm, it recognises the position of the person's face, and then controls the worm gear mechanism according to the position information of the face to achieve the automatic adjustment of the fan's orientation.

*** How to use the face recognition function of AI lens to realise the automatic starting and orientation adjustment of the fan? ***

The automatic startup and orientation adjustment of the fan using the face recognition function of the AI lens is mainly realised by the face detection algorithm and the mechanical drive system. When someone approaches the fan, the AI lens captures the face information of the person and passes the information to the control module. The control module controls the worm gear mechanism to rotate according to the face position information, thus adjusting the fan orientation so that the fan is always aligned with the person's face position.
