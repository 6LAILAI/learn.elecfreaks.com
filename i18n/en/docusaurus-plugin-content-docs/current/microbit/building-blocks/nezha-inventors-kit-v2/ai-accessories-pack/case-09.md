# Case 09 AI Anti-Theft Bar


## Introduction

The purpose of this lesson is to guide students to use the Nezha Inventor‘s Kit V2 and the AI Accessories Pack to build an AI item security bar system. Through the feature learning function of the AI lens, students will learn about the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in securing items. Students will learn how to build an intelligent anti-theft system that recognizes specific items and triggers an alarm and flashing lights when the item leaves the camera's field of view, improving their STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) skills, and fostering problem-solving and creativity.

## Teaching Process

### Introduction

>Teachers can guide students to think about the following questions: What are the applications of feature learning technology in their lives?

Hello everyone, today we are going to enter the wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence and learn how to make an amazing AI item security bar system using the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 and AI Accessories Pack. Have you ever thought of having a camera that recognizes specific items and triggers an alarm and flashing light when the item is removed? That's what we're going to tackle today, so let's get started with this creative and technically challenging project.

### Exploration

>Break out into groups and have students think about how they can use an AI lens to create an AI item security fence.

- How can feature learning techniques be applied to an item security system?
- How to use Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 and AI Accessories Pack to build an AI Item Theft Bar System?
- How to use a feature learning function to make the camera recognize specific items?

### Exploration

>Work in groups and follow your own design plan to create an AI item security fence device using building block materials.

Follow your own design plan and use the building block materials to create an AI item security fence device.

### Teamwork and Presentation

Students are divided into small groups and work together to create and program cases.

Students are encouraged to cooperate, communicate and share their experiences with each other.

Each group has the opportunity to present the cases they have produced to the other groups.

#### Sample case effect

Through the feature learning function of the AI lens, it learns about a specific item, and when this item leaves the camera's field of view, the camera will sound an alarm and flash a light.

### Reflection

>Sharing in groups allows students in each group to share their production process and insights, summarize the problems and solutions they encountered, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.
