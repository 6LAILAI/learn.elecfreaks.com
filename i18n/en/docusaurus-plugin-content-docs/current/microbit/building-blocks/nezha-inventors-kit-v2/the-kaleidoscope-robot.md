# Case 05 The Kaleidoscope Robot

## Introduction

Kaleidoscope painting is an art form inspired by traditional kaleidoscope installations. In this type of painting, artists use a variety of colourful materials and techniques to create fascinating kaleidoscopic effects. They create optical illusions and visual feasts through detailed patterns, cyclical geometric shapes and strong colour contrasts. Kaleidoscope paintings often reveal gorgeous and mysterious images that bring the viewer a psychedelic and wondrous artistic experience.

In this lesson, students will learn how to use the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a kaleidoscopic robot that can draw different patterns. Through this case, we will learn the principles of motor control, programming concepts and the integration of art and science. Through hands-on building and practice, students will develop creativity, problem-solving skills and teamwork.

## Teaching Objectives 

- Understand how motors work and how they are controlled.
- Master the basic skills of building kaleidoscopic robots using blocks.
- Learn to control the speed of the motor through programming to achieve different patterns to draw.
- Develop creativity, problem solving skills and teamwork.

## Teaching Process

### Introduce

>Introduce students to the background and objectives of Kaleidoscope Robotics to stimulate their interest and curiosity.

Kaleidoscope painting is an art form inspired by traditional kaleidoscope installations. In this type of painting, artists use a variety of colourful materials and techniques to create fascinating kaleidoscopic effects. They create optical illusions and visual feasts through detailed patterns, cyclical geometric shapes and strong colour contrasts. Kaleidoscope paintings often reveal gorgeous and mysterious images that bring the viewer a psychedelic and fantastic artistic experience.

If we could create a robot to paint kaleidoscope patterns, how do you think it would work? Have you thought about how to control the movement of the robot and draw different patterns?

### Exploration 

>In small groups, students will be asked to think about how to create a kaleidoscope robot using block materials, focusing on the relationship between the kaleidoscope pattern and the movement of the motor.

- Understand how motors work and how they are controlled.
- Master the basic skills of building a kaleidoscopic robot using blocks.
- Learn to control the speed of the motor through programming to achieve different patterns to draw.
- Develop creativity, problem solving skills and teamwork.

### Practice

>Work in groups to create a kaleidoscopic robot using block materials according to your own design plan.

Create a kaleidoscope robot out of building blocks according to your own design.
