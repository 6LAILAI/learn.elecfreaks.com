# Case 16 The Seesaw

## Introduction 

A seesaw is a classic amusement ride that is able to use the principle of leverage to achieve balance at both ends. In this lesson we will learn how a seesaw works and use Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a seesaw that can swing.

## Teaching Objectives

- Understand the basic principles and applications of seesaws.
- Learn how gearing works and its applications.
- Learn how to use gearing to balance a seesaw.
- Design and build suitable mechanical structures to support the movement of a seesaw.
- Develop teamwork, problem solving and creative thinking skills.

## Teaching Preparation

[Nezha Inventor's Kit V2](https://www.elecfreaks.com/nezha-inventor-s-kit-v2-for-micro-bit.html)


## Teaching Process

### Introduce

>Introduce students to the background and objectives of making a seesaw to stimulate their interest and curiosity.

You must all have played with a seesaw! A seesaw is a very interesting plaything that allows us to feel the wonders of the leverage principle. Do you know how a seesaw achieves balance? In this lesson, we will explore the principle of a seesaw together and make a special seesaw with the Nezha Inventor Kit V2.

### Exploration

>Discuss in groups and get students thinking about how to make a seesaw out of block materials.

- What is a see-saw? What are its features and applications?
- How does a seesaw achieve balance? What role does the principle of leverage play in this?
- What is the gear train? What is its role in the making of a seesaw?
- How can you use Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a seesaw that balances itself?
- How does the design and mechanics of the teeter totter affect the balance? How do you adjust the balance point of a seesaw?

### Practice

>Work in groups to create a see-saw using block materials according to your own design.

Make a seesaw out of blocks according to your own design.

### Demonstration

>Present in groups and compare the results and effectiveness of each group.

#### Result

Press the crash sensor to start the seesaw, press the crash sensor again to stop the seesaw.

### Reflection

>Share in groups so that students in each group can share their production process and insights, summarise the problems and solutions they encountered, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.
