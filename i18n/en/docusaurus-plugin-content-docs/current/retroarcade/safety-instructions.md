# Safety instructions

Before operating the RETRO Arcade, please read and familiarize yourself with the following precautions for use. Users should strictly observe all usage precautions and ensure that the RETRO Arcade is properly assembled and in proper working condition. The following operating principles should be followed:

Do not disassemble or in any other way alter the structure of the RETRO Arcade yourself.

Do not spill water on the RETRO Arcade body.

Do not place the RETRO Arcade in a location where it can be easily dropped.

Do not use detergents or water to clean the RETRO Arcade. We recommend that you use a cotton cloth moistened with alcohol to scrub it.

Please do not stuff paper shavings, dust, chewing gum, etc. into the RETRO Arcade interface. It is very difficult to clean foreign objects that are in the interface.
