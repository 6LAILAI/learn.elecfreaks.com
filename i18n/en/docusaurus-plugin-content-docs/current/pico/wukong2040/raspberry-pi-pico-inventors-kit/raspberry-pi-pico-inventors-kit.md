![](./images/wukong2040-inventors-introduction-01.png)

## Introduction

The Wukong2040 Inventor's Kit is a kit developed for inventors learning to program electronics. It includes a multifunctional expansion board-the Wukong2040, designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico, as well as 11 different types of sensors and actuators to create a wide range of interesting and practical projects.

The Wukong2040 Inventor's Kit supports MicroBlocks graphical programming, making it easy for beginners with no experience in electronics programming to get started and learn about programming as fast as possible. The Wukong2040 expansion board, developed by the team at ELECFREAKS, features a modular design with powerful on-board functionality for experienced creators to explore the CircuitPython code programming style in greater depth and create projects quickly.

What's more, the team at ELECFREAKS provides you with a wealth of learning examples that can help you quickly navigate the world of creators and apply them to real-life situations.

## Powerful Wukong2040

The **Wukong2040** is a multifunctional expansion board for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

It features an onboard buzzer, A\B button, rainbow light, motor interface, reset button and more to satisfy creators' IO programming and peripheral expansion needs.

In terms of battery life, it supports high-capacity 18650 batteries and has an onboard intelligent power management chip with a thoughtful power indicator, which can last for over 120 minutes of normal use.

In terms of construction, it uses a standard 7 x 11 square block frame as its base, allowing the Wukong2040 to be extended in a variety of vivid shapes.

> The Raspberry Pi Pico is a high performance, small form factor microcontroller development board designed by Raspberry Pi. Powered by Raspberry Pi's own RP2040 microcontroller chip, it features an ARM Cortex M0 + dual-core processor running at up to 133MHz, 264KB of SRAM and 2MB of memory, and up to 26 multi-function GPIO pins on board.
